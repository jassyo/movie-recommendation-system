# Movie Recommendation System

This Movie Recommendation System leverages content-based filtering to suggest movies based on the features of a movie that a user has already shown interest in. Using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity, the system compares movie attributes like genre, cast, director, and plot keywords to recommend similar titles.
